# Ressurection Church of Christ

We take responsibility for improving the well-being of our city, Almaty, for fulfilling God's will in all of our relationships. We strive towards together starting with our mutual spiritual upbringing in faithfulness to God and charity towards our neighbors in all aspects of our lives.
